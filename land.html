        <h3 class="welcome">Welcome to the Geriatric Cancer Patient Assessment... You are one step away form optimizing your health and well-being.</h3>
        <p>Geriatric assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of an older adult's overall health status, functional abilities, social support, and other relevant factors. It involves a multidimensional approach to assess various aspects of an older individual's physical, mental, and social well-being. The primary goal of a geriatric assessment is to develop a tailored care plan that addresses the specific needs and challenges of the older adult.</p>
        <p>This assessment is designed to evaluate the needs and conditions of geriatric cancer patients. It provides a comprehensive analysis of various aspects related to the patient's health and well-being.</p>
        <p>Please proceed to the "Patient Information" section to enter the necessary details for assessment.</p>
        <p>Geriatric cancer refers to cancer that occurs in elderly individuals, typically those aged 65 years and older. As people age, the risk of developing cancer increases, and geriatric cancer becomes more prevalent due to various factors, including cumulative exposure to environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and age-related changes in the body's cells.</p>

        <p class="importance">Why Geriatric assessment?</p>
        <p>Comprehensive Evaluation: It provides a holistic view of an older adult's health, taking into account various physical, cognitive, functional, and psychosocial factors that can impact their well-being.</p>
        <p>Individualized Care Planning: The assessment helps identify specific areas of concern and develops tailored care plans that address the unique needs and preferences of the older adult. It can guide appropriate interventions and support services.</p>
        <p>Early Detection of Issues: Geriatric assessment can help detect health problems, functional impairments, or cognitive decline at early stages when interventions may be more effective in preventing or managing these conditions.</p> 
        <p>Care Coordination: It facilitates coordination among healthcare professionals, caregivers, and support services to ensure a collaborative approach to the care of older adults.</p>
        <p>Prognostic Information: Geriatric assessment can provide prognostic information about an individual's overall health status, functional abilities, and potential risks, aiding in shared decision-making and planning for future care.</p>
